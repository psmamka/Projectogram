# Projectogram and Reconstructogram
A projectogram is a visual representation of the operation of projecting higher dimenesional data to a lower dimensional space, whereby projections of single-pixel images are presented in a matrix form. A reconstructogram, on the other hand, visualizes the reconstruction outcome of single pixel images from the available projections.

## Motive
The concept of having mere access to a smaller, more compact form of data compared to the existing outer information is central to any form of physical measurements, and perhaps all human observations in general. And yet the issue of reduced dimensionality is of prominent significance in a special class of inverse problems, known as tomographic image reconstruction. Salient examples in this category include medical imaging modalities based on use of X-rays, radioactive molucules, and magnetic resonance phenomena.

The technique presented here is less about solving a particular inverse problem of image reconstruction, focusing rather on a reprsentation of the qualities of projection and reconstruction systems. 

As a particular example, an image masking technique is presented where non-negative prior information about image pixel values is used to improve reconstructed image quality.
